# ASAPP Chat Backend Challenge v1
### Overview
This is a Python boilerplate which runs an HTTP Server configured to answer the endpoints defined in 
[the challenge you received](https://backend-challenge.asapp.engineering/).

All endpoints are configured under `./app/endpoints`, where each file contains *TODO* comments where you are free to implement your solution.
Feel free to add supporting functionality wherever you want or move things around (as long as the API is respected), and don't forget to add tests under `./tests`.

### Prerequisites

- python >= 3.x
- flask  >  2.x
- pytest >  7.x

### How to run it

flask run
```

##### Note
You can remove/modify this file for documenting your solution.
